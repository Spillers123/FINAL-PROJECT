# FINAL-PROJECT
##POLYMORPHISM- my program on polymorphism is about your daily calorie intake, and you can list down what you want to eat but you'll need to put how much calories it has, the calorie amount is set to a specific amount and it will give you a sign when you have reached the maximum calorie intake. 

##COMPOSTION- my program on composition is based on your daily routine where you can input the things you need and want to do today and type done when you're finished and it will show you a list of what you wanted to do.

##ASYNCHRONOUS- my program on asynchronous is an api based project and I have made a program where you can input the movie title and it will show you the info's all about the movie including the picture of the movie.
